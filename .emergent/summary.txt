The previous AI engineer successfully initiated LuxServ 365, focusing on a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The initial phase delivered a feature-rich application, including guest and owner portals, an admin dashboard, and notification systems (email/Telegram). However, significant challenges arose during deployment to Railway, Vercel, and Render, marked by dependency conflicts (npm ERESOLVE), authentication errors (MongoDB 'bad auth'), and persistent functional bugs in the Guest Portal (submission issues) and Admin Dashboard (UI rendering, bulk actions, status resets).

A pivotal architectural decision was made to shift from the custom backend for guest and owner requests to a Google Forms/Sheets-based solution, coupled with Google Apps Script for notifications. This was driven by persistent bugs and the user's desire for a simpler, more robust, and potentially free solution for data management. The engineer has since focused on integrating these Google services into the frontend. The latest work involves setting up the Owner Portal with Google Forms for messaging and embedding Google Docs/Photos for inspection reports and property albums.

The LuxServ 365 application aims to be a conversion-optimized landing page and management portal for vacation rental hosts. Initially, it featured a React/FastAPI/MongoDB stack with:
*   **Owner Portal:** Login, messaging, inspection reports, photo albums.
*   **Guest Portal:** Comprehensive service request form with various request types, priority levels, and photo uploads.
*   **Admin Dashboard:** Password-protected access for staff to manage guest requests (view, update status, notes, email reply, bulk operations).
*   **Notifications:** Email (Gmail) and Telegram alerts for guest requests.
*   **Content & Branding:** Updated contact, services, logo, testimonials, mission page, pricing adjustments.

Due to persistent deployment and functional issues, the core data management for guest and owner interactions has shifted significantly. The new requirement involves leveraging **Google Forms** for guest requests and owner messages, **Google Sheets** for data storage, and **Google Apps Script** for notifications. The Admin Portal will ideally interface with this new Google-centric data, and the Owner Portal will also display inspection reports and property photos directly from **Google Drive/Photos**. The goal is a simplified, more robust, and cost-effective system.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-stack Architecture:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **UI/Styling:** Shadcn UI components, Tailwind CSS.
-   **API Communication:** Axios (frontend), Pydantic (backend data validation), Motor (async PyMongo).
-   **Data Management:** Google Forms, Google Sheets, Google Apps Script (for automation and notifications).
-   **Deployment Platforms:** Railway, Vercel, Render (encountered various issues during deployment attempts).
-   **Notifications:**  (Email),  (Telegram) - now mostly handled by Google Apps Script.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a standard full-stack setup with a React frontend, a FastAPI backend, and initially MongoDB for data persistence, but has significantly pivoted towards Google services for data capture and management.



**Key Files and Changes:**

*   **/app/frontend/src/components/GuestPortal.jsx**:
    *   **Importance:** Previously handled guest service requests via the custom backend.
    *   **Changes:** Completely refactored to embed a Google Form. The original form elements and submission logic using  have been removed, replaced by an iframe embedding the Google Form.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/AdminDashboard.jsx (NEW)**:
    *   **Importance:** Central management hub for LuxServ 365 staff. Displays guest requests.
    *   **Changes:** Faced numerous bug fixes related to data display (e.g., guest names missing, status not persisting) and UI interactions (buttons not working, white screen errors). The data source for requests is intended to be Google Sheets, though the full integration and update mechanism are still being refined. Logic for handling photo display was also adjusted to prevent errors when no photos are present.
*   **/app/frontend/src/components/OwnerDashboard.jsx**:
    *   **Importance:** Owner-specific dashboard for messages, inspection reports, and property photos.
    *   **Changes:** The Messages tab has been updated to embed a Google Form for owner inquiries. The Inspection Reports and Property Photos sections have been modified to display links to Google Docs and Google Photos albums provided by the user, replacing the previous custom upload/display functionality. Redundant report/photo categories were consolidated to single Property Inspection Report and Property Inspection Photos sections.
*   **/app/frontend/src/services/api.js**:
    *   **Importance:** Centralized API calls for both frontend and backend.
    *   **Changes:** Functions related to  were modified, initially to remove photo upload logic, and then largely bypassed for guest requests as the Guest Portal now uses a Google Form. Admin API calls for , , and  were debugged and refactored multiple times to correctly interact with the backend (which itself was expected to eventually work with Google Sheets).
*   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    *   **Importance:** FastAPI backend with API endpoints and DB interaction.
    *   **Changes:**  model adjusted;  and  endpoints were a primary focus for debugging authentication and data retrieval errors. Deprecation warnings for Pydantic validators and  were noted. A significant change involved fixing the MongoDB connection string to resolve No write concern mode named majority errors.
*   **/app/backend/.env**:
    *   **Importance:** Stores environment variables like , , , , , , , .
    *   **Changes:** Values for , , ,  were updated multiple times during troubleshooting based on user input to fix authentication and notification issues.

<pending_tasks>
-   Implement QR code generation for properties linking to the Guest Portal.
-   Enhance Admin Dashboard with advanced search functionality and a UI for generating reports (this would now ideally integrate with Google Sheets).
-   Develop a comprehensive Owner Onboarding System.
-   Implement a complete invoicing system for owners and guests, potentially using Stripe integration.
-   Ensure the Google Sheets-based guest and owner data is properly reflected and manageable within the Admin Dashboard.
-   Ensure email and Telegram notifications are reliably sent upon Google Form submissions for both guests and owners.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on transitioning the Owner Portal's messaging, inspection reports, and property photos functionality to Google services, mirroring the change made for the Guest Portal. The user provided a Google Form link for owner messages (), and a corresponding Google Sheet (). This form was successfully embedded into the  file to replace the old messaging system.

Additionally, the user provided a Google Docs link for inspection reports () and a Google Photos album link for property photos (). The  was modified to embed or link to these external Google resources. The previous custom components for inspection reports and photo albums were simplified, focusing on displaying a single Property Inspection Report and Property Inspection Photos link/embed, as per the user's latest request. The unread/read status for messages in the owner portal was also removed.
